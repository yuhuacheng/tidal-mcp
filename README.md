# TIDAL MCP: My Custom Picks üåüüéß

![Demo: Music Recommendations in Action](./assets/tidal_mcp_demo.gif)

Most music platforms offer recommendations ‚Äî Daily Discovery, Top Artists, New Arrivals, etc. ‚Äî but even with the state-of-the-art system, they often feel too "aggregated". I wanted something more custom and context-aware.

With TIDAL MCP, you can ask for things like:
> *"Based on my last 10 favorites, find similar tracks ‚Äî but only ones from recent years."*
>
> *"Find me tracks like those in this playlist, but slower and more acoustic."*

The LLM filters and curates results using your input, finds similar tracks via TIDAL‚Äôs API, and builds new playlists directly in your account.

## MCP Client Configuration

### Claude Desktop Configuration

To add this MCP server to Claude Desktop, you need to update the MCP configuration file. Here's an example configuration:
(you can specify the port by adding an optional `env` section with the `TIDAL_MCP_PORT` environment variable)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "TIDAL Integration": {
      "command": "/path/to/your/uv",
      "env": {
        "TIDAL_MCP_PORT": "5100"
      },
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "requests",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli]",
        "--with",
        "flask",
        "--with",
        "tidalapi",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "/path/to/your/project/tidal-mcp/mcp_server/server.py"
      ]
    }
